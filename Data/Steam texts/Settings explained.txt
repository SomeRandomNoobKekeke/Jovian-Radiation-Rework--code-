[h2] Theory [/h2]
Settings are not linked to saves, they are global
In multiplayer clients take host settings, only host or client with all permission can change them

Radiation amount is how deep is here in radiation in map units
Amount for location is Front.X - Location.X
Amount for entities on a level is between start and end location amount - radiation blocked by depth of the water
